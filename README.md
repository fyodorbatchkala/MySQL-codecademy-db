# MySQL-codecademy-db

This is a project I completed after a course # "Relational databases. Basics. MySQL". #

The goal was to describe the storage model of a popular website: movie search, booking.com, wikipedia, online store.

Requirements for the course project:
1. Make a general textual description of the database and the tasks it solves;
2. The minimum number of tables is 10;
3. Provide scripts for creating a database structure (with primary keys, indexes, foreign keys);
4. Create an ERDiagram for the database;
5. Provide scripts for filling the database with data;
6. Provide characteristic selections scripts (including groupings, JOINs, nested tables);

I used codecademy.com as a reference and tried to create a database based on the principles of the CodeCademy website.
